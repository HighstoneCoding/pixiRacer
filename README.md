#pixiRacer
=========

This project uses Pixi.js which can be found at https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js
special thanks to Gary Ferguson (https://github.com/HighstoneCoding) and Lib (need a link for you man)
for their artwork.

To-Do Art (sizes for images needed in pixels):
>- Background creation. (640x1920)
>- Enemy Sprites. (we have one now thanks lib but we need more!)(22x30)
>- Vans (Weapon pickups).(30x64)
>- NPC Cars (neutral obstacle). (22x30)

To-Do Code:
>- fix controls, these are mad broken and too slow for this kind of game.
>- add a sprite spawn function.
>- add enemy paths.
>- add collision detection.
